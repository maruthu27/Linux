Instructions
Its mandatory to stop instanceA where the root volume needs to be increased.

Perform a snapshot of the root volume (wait for the snapshot progress bar to start showing some percentage).

Create an t2.micro instanceB  with an AMZ AMI Linux in the same VPC and Subnet as the instance of the root volume to be increased.

Attach the root volume from instanceA to instanceB (remember the device position of the original instance -- ex: /dev/sda1).

Increase/modify the capacity of the root volume from instanceA using the AWS console.

Log into instanceB, at the terminal type '$ lsblk' to check the devices on the OS (identify the root volume from instanceA).
Verify if the capacity has changed:

lsblk -f
[ec2-user ~]$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0  30G  0 disk
└─xvdf1 202:81   0   8G  0 part


Identify the name of what partition you need to increase:

The volume /dev/xvdf has a partition, /dev/xvdf1. While the size of the volume is 30G, the size of the partition is still 8 GB and must be extended.


Grow the partition /dev/xvdf1:

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo growpart /dev/xvdf 1


Verify using lsblk if the device capacity was increased:

[ec2-user ~]$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  16G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0  16G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0  30G  0 disk
└─xvdf1 202:81   0  30G  0 part


Mount the device on /mnt:

[ec2-user ~]$ mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt


Extend/grow the filesystem:

[ec2-user ~]$ xfs_growfs /dev/xvdf1


Verify if the filesystem increased:

[ec2-user ~]$ df -h
Filesystem       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1        16G  1.9G  6.2G  12% /
/dev/xvdf1        30G   45M  8.0G   1% /mnt


Unmount the device:

[ec2-user ~]$ umount /mnt


Detach the root volume using the AWS console.

Finally attach the root volume to instanceA and start it.
